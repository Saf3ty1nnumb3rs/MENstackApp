# WISHkey - WDI 14 Project 2
#### This project will be my first project utilizing a MEN stack deployed with Heroku! WISHkey is an app that will provide a platform for users to declare their love of whisk(e)y! A user can declare their favorites and add some great finds to our online database broken down by country or region. It's like an online wish list for whisky from around the world. Have a favorite whisky? Sign up and add it on WISHkey!!!!!
